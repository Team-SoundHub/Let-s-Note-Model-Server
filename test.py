To find the most proper lower-pitch chord in the range D2 ~ B2 (35 ~ 24) based on your current music note, we need to analyze the given music note suggestions. Here is the analysis of your music note suggestions:

[['23'], [], [], ['23'], [], [], ['23'], [], [], ['23'], ['24'], [], ['26'], [], ['24'], ['23'], ['21'], [], [], ['19'], [], [], ['19'], [], [], ['19'], [], ['19'], ['21'], [], ['23'], [], ['21'], ['19'], ['18'], [], ['16'], [], [], ['16'], [], [], ['23'], [], ['14'], [], ['16'], [], ['18'], ['19'], ['21'], [], ['23'], ['24'], ['23'], ['12'], ['14'], ['16'], [], ['16'], ['18'], ['19'], [], ['19'], ['21'], ['23'], ['24'], ['23']]
From the given suggestions, we can see that the following notes are present: 23, 24, 26, 21, 19, 18, 16, 14, 12.

Based on these notes, the most proper lower-pitch chord in the range D2 ~ B2 would be the D major chord (D2 F#2 A2). This chord consists of the notes D (23), F# (26), and A (19).

Therefore, the suggested chord is [['23', '26', '19'], [], [], ['23', '26', '19'], [], [], ['23', '26', '19'], [], [], ['23', '26', '19'], ['24'], [], ['26'], [], ['24'], ['23'], ['21'], [], [], ['19'], [], [], ['19'], [], [], ['19'], [], ['19'], ['21'], [], ['23'], [], ['21'], ['19'], ['18'], [], ['16'], [], [], ['16'], [], [], ['23'], [], ['14'], [], ['16'], [], ['18'], ['19'], ['21'], [], ['23'], ['24'], ['23'], ['12'], ['14'], ['16'], [], ['16'], ['18'], ['19'], [], ['19'], ['21'], ['23'], ['24'], ['23']]

Please note that this chord is based on the given notes and the range you specified. It may not be the only possible chord, but it is the most proper one considering the given constraints.
